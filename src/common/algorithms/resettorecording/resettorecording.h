/// \brief Algorithm to copy the recorded pitches into the tuning curve.
///
/// This algorith simply copies the recorded pitches. This works also
/// in the case where the keys were only partially recorded. If A4 has been
/// recorded and the ConcertPitch is different, the pitches will be shifted
/// to the wanted ConcertPitch. Therefore, to get an unshifted copy, the
/// ConcertPitch in the settings should be the same as the recorded A4.
/// If A4 was recorded it is assumed that A4=440Hz.
///
/// This algorithm shows the coder how algorithms can be implemented. It can
/// also be used by the users to copy or shift an existing tune.
