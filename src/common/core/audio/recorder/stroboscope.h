/// \brief Class for a stroboscopic tuning indicator
///
/// Ordinary stroboscopic tuners show the analog audio signal amplitude in
/// terms of light intensity masked by a rotating disk. See e.g.
/// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_tuner#How_a_strobe_tuner_works
///
/// Doing the same in our software would require to send the complete PCM data
/// to a stroboscopic drawer which would display it in real time pixel by pixel.
/// This would be computationally expensive. Moreover, the messaging sytem
/// would not be suitable for such a data stream.
///
/// We therefore choose a different method. The AudioRecorderAdapter holds an
/// instance of this class and calls the function pushRawData (see below),
/// transmitting all PCM data. This data is reorganized in packages of the
/// size mSamplesPerFrame. Each frame is convolved with a complex number
/// rotating on its unit circle. The speed at which the complex number
/// rotates corresponds to the expected frequencies of the partials, as
/// specified by the function set Frequencies. The result is a set of
/// complex numbers (one for each partial), encoding the intensity of the
/// partial and its complex phase shift. This data is sent (only once for
/// each frame) via the messaging system.
///
/// The TuningIndicatorDrawer listens to these messages and draws horizontal
/// bars with phase-shifted rainbow colors.
/// \see AudioRecorderAdapter
/// \see TuningIndicatorDrawer
