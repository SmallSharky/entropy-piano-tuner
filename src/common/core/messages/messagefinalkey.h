///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// \brief Class for a message reporting a finally detected key.
///
/// When a piano key is played in the recording mode, the EPT continuously
/// determines the 'rolling FFT' and uses this information to make a guess
/// about the key which is pressed. This guess should be the same as long as
/// the same key is played, but due to inaccuracies it may occasionally fail
/// or fluctuate. The system keeps track of these changes and, upon completion
/// of the recording, determines the 'final key' by a majority decision. This
/// final key is then emitted by this message to inform the other components
/// of the software.
