/// \brief The Message class
///
/// An instance of this class represents a single message. Messages can
/// be of different type, which are listed here in the enum below.
/// For example, Message::MSG_CLEAR_RECORDING would be such a message type.
/// The constructor Message(Message::MSG_CLEAR_RECORDING) would turn this
/// into a message object. The message type of a message object cannot
/// be changed during its lifetime.
///
/// See also: MessageHandler for sending and MessageListener
/// for receiving messages.
