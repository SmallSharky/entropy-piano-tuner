////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// \brief Class for estimating the overpull needed in a pitch raise.
///
/// If a piano is heavily out of tune, one has to perform a pitch raise.
/// The rising string tension increases the load on the soundboard, leading to
/// an elastic deformation of the soundboard. This deformation in turn lowers
/// the pitches. Overpulling means to tune the strings a little bit sharper
/// than intended so that the expected loss during the tuning process is
/// compensated.
///
/// The overpull algorithm is implemented in a fully automatic manner. If in
/// the recording mode enough keys are measured (all with a distance less or
/// equal than a fifth), and if the piano is flat (or sharp) by more than
/// 5%, the overpull curve is automatically displayed in magenta color in
/// the tuning window.
///
/// The overpull curve decreases during tuning and finally becomes flat and
/// vanishes entirely. That is, for each key the overpull of all other keys
/// is newly calculated.
///
/// The instance of the overpull estimator is held by the SignalAnalyzer.
