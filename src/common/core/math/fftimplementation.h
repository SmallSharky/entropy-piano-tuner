///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// \brief Thread-safe implementation of fftw3
///
/// <b>USAGE:</b> FFT's can be carried out simply by calling the
/// function calculateFFT with the corresponding arguments. If a given
/// instance has to carry out a larger number of FFTs using the same vector
/// sizes it is meaningful to optimize the calculation by initially calling the
/// function optimize with the input vector as the argument.
///
/// <b>DETAILS:</b>
/// A Fourier transformation using fftw3 requires two steps. First a
/// so-called 'plan' has to be computed which optimizes the
/// FFT algorithm. Then in a second step the actual Fourier transform is
/// carried out. A plan may be kept for several calculations as long
/// as the location of the vectors and their sizes are not changed.
/// By keeping a plan the computation time is drastically reduced.
///
/// As of now, the second step (the FFT) is thread-safe while the first one is not.
/// This means that only one thread is allowed to create a plan at a given
/// time. To this end this implementation class protects all accesses
/// to planmaking by a static mutex. In addition, it keeps local input
/// and output vectors with a constant location.
///
/// The class provides two types of FFTs, namely, real to complex
/// and comples to real. The second one is the inverse of the first one.
///
/// Since memory allocation should be carried out with the inbuilt
/// allocation function of FFTW3, the implementation copies the vectors
/// into local member vectors by memcpy.
