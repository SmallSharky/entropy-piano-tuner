/// \brief Stroboscopic view adapter for Qt
///
/// This is the implementation of the stroboscopic view adapter for Qt.
/// The essential function is drawStroboscope, which depends on a vector of
/// complex numbers. The stroboscope shows stripes of rainbow colorscales with an
/// intensity proportional to the absolute values of the complex numbers
/// and a horizontal shift proportional to the phase of the complex numbers.
/// This function is time-critical and uses direct memory access.
///
/// This class is derived from GraphicsViewAdapterForQt. It is therefore a
/// special type of GraphicsView which is able to display a stroboscope.
/// \see GraphicsViewAdapterForQt
